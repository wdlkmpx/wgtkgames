## gFifteen

gFifteen is a graphical implementation of the old puzzle game "fifteen". The goal is to move the numbered tiles from the random starting position into the following arrangement, with the empty square at the bottom right:

|   |   |   |   | 
|---|---|---|---| 
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 
| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 
| 9 | 10| 11| 12| 
| 13| 14| 15|   | 

You must do this by moving tiles that are next to the empty square into the empty square location. Click on a tile once to move it into the empty location.

All puzzles provided are solveable. For additional challenge, attempt to complete each puzzle in as few moves as possible, or as quickly as possible. Bobby Fischer was known to have completed the puzzle in 25 seconds in a public demonstration. Using this software (which can be used faster than a real board) I was once able to complete it in 24 seconds.
