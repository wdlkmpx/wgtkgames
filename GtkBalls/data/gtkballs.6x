.B gtkballs
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents 
.BR GtkBalls.
.BR GtkBalls
is a simple logic game. The goal of this game is to make the highest score
by matching a number of balls of the same color in a horizontal, vertical or
diagonal line. For further information on how to play this game refer to the
rules section in this manual page.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\--display [hostname:dpy]"
Specify what display GtkBalls should use. See
.BR X
(1x) for more information on the syntax of hostname and display.
.SH RULES
The standard play area of GtkBalls is a 9x9 grid (it can be changed through
"Rules" option in ingame menu). When GtkBalls is first started a number of
balls are placed in a random manner on the grid. Balls are in different colors
(and/or shape). You may move balls on the grid by selecting them and selecting
an empty square on the grid as destination for the ball you selected. Balls
will only move if they are not blocked by other balls. Each time you move a
ball, unless you score some points, new balls appear in a random manner on the
grid. If the grid is full then the game is lost. However this is bound to
happen, your goal is to make the highest score. In order to do this you must
make lines in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal way with balls of the same
color. By default a line must have at least five balls of the same color (it
can also be changed through "Rules" option in ingame menu). Making a line of
minimum amount of the balls, specifed in rules, will earn you twice the points
for your score. If you make lines over minimum amount of the balls it will earn
you even more points. In order to help you decide which ball you are going to
move, there is an indicator on top of the grid that shows what colors the next
balls that will appear on the grid will be.
